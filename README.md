# Talks

```bash
$ go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present@latest
$ present -notes
```

> Note: Visit the link that the present program prints out in the console (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:3999/). If you use `localhost` instead, then the code play might not work.
There is another option that allows you to run code from go.dev/play instead, which is `-use_playground`.

> Note: When entering multiline code in the editable code blocks, use `Shift+Enter` for new lines instead of `Enter`. Using `Enter` will start a new `<pre>` block, while `Shift+Enter` keeps everything within a single block as intended.
